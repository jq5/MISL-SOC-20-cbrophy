# Main Project

This will be where my actual project will be.

## Idea

- Main Screen
	- Active video capture from camera with filters applied on top as desired.
	- Button to switch to second screen (see below).
	- Button to edit what filter is applied.
	- Button to capture photo.
	- Button to choose from preset filters.
	
- Second Screen
	- File Manager to select and edit already captured photos and previously unedited photos.
	- Button to return to Main Screen
